I've closed this phone with KCOL0 hardwired to ground to access the bootrom.
The screws for the back are taped to the battery.
There is tape over the slots that can possibly be gently cut or torn off. It was part of securing KCOL0 without a soldering iron.
It has a factory super partition. The user and cache partitions are from a roughly unrelated backup.
I was going to see if I could move the state of another phone onto it, but didn't complete testing; there's no need to continue that unless interested.
