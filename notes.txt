For boot and /boot, which contains kernel, dtb, and ramdisk, 2024-01 maybe tools/android-unpackbootimg .
For super and /system partition, which contains OS, 2024-01 maybe tools/mount_super.bash which uses tools/parse-android-dynparts .
For userdata and /data, which contains user state, maybe tarball because hardware encryption for now. Maybe this for external storage too.

Experiences transferring data from a live device:
    - connecting to linux hotspot: slow
    - connecting via USB tether on old phone: ~12MB/s
    i suspect it can go faster, as the device something like 20MB/s to the local wifi router (the network didn't provide for intracommunication)

Although hardware master keys are stored, logical keys may be dumpable.
Full-disk encryption keys may be dumpable using `dmsetup table --showkeys`.
Folder-specific encryption keys pass from /data/misc/vold/user_keys through vold to fscrypt, haven't found or made a tool at this time.
Encryption keys can be extracted from a memory image or code injection.
    I'm unsure what 'mtkclient dumpsram' does, but it may produce a memory image.

            note: i noticed somewhere it said android upgraded its aes to store keys in cpu registers to make this harder
